Description: touch typing tutor for KDE
 KTouch is an aid for learning how to type with speed and accuracy.  It
 provides a sample text to type and indicates which fingers should be used for
 each key.
 .
 A collection of lessons are included for a wide range of different languages
 and keyboard layouts, and typing statistics are used to dynamically adjust the
 level of difficulty.
 .
 This package is part of the KDE education module.
